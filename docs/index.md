InternHive (IH) is a **desktop app for managing your industry contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, InternHive can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

* If you are interested in using InternHive, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing InternHive, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
